				<h2 align="center">In popular music</h2>	
				<p>In commercial popular music, instrumental tracks are sometimes renderings, remixes of a corresponding release that features vocals, but they may also be compositions originally conceived without vocals. One example of a genre in which both vocal/instrumental and solely instrumental songs are produced is blues. A blues band often uses mostly songs that have lyrics that are sung, but during the band's show, they may also perform instrumental songs which only include electric guitar, harmonica, upright bass/electric bass and drum kit.</p>

			<h2 align="center">Some information about instrumental music</h2>	
			<p>Some recordings which include brief or non-musical use of the human voice are typically considered instrumentals. Examples include songs with the following:

Short verbal interjections (as in "Tequila" or "Topsy" or "Wipe Out" or "The Hustle" or "Bentley's Gonna Sort You Out")
Repetitive nonsense words (e.g., "la la..." (as in "Calcutta") or "Woo Hoo")
Non-musical spoken passages in the background of the track (e.g., "To Live Is to Die" by Metallica; "Wasteland" by Chelsea Grin)
Wordless vocal effects, such as drones (e.g., "Rockit" or "Flying")
Vocal percussion, such as beatbox B-sides on rap singles
Yodeling (e.g., "Hocus Pocus")
Whistling (e.g., "I Was Kaiser Bill's Batman" or "Colonel Bogey March")
Spoken statements at the end of the track (e.g., God Bless the Children of the Beast by Mötley Crüe, For the Love of God by Steve Vai)
Non-musical vocal recordings taken from other media (e.g., "Vampires" by Godsmack)
Field recordings which may or may not contain non-lyrical words. (e.g., many songs by Godspeed You! Black Emperor and other post-rock bands.)
Songs including actual musical—rhythmic, melodic, and lyrical—vocals might still be categorized as instrumentals if the vocals appear only as a short part of an extended piece (e.g., "Unchained Melody" (Les Baxter), "TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)", "Pick Up the Pieces", "The Hustle", "Fly, Robin, Fly", "Get Up and Boogie", "Do It Any Way You Wanna", and "Gonna Fly Now"), though this definition is loose and subjective.

Falling just outside of that definition is "Theme From Shaft" by Isaac Hayes.</p>
